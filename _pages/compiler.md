[Zonnon compiler] for .NET was developed in 2004-2011 at ETH Zurich. A source code of a slighlty reduced fork of this compiler was then shared on [CodePlex]. Since CodePlex was shut down end of 2017, the source code for the Zonnon compiler was copied to [GitHub].

Currently builds are only available at [ETH Zonnon Compiler homepage](http://zonnon.ethz.ch/compiler/download.html).
